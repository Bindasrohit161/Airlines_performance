Airline Delay performance
==========================

Flight delays canâ€™t be helped. They are a by-product of global trade and tourism. 
The more we all travel the greater the demand and pressures on infrastructure and, ultimately, 
the risk of human error.
Nowadays, the aviation industry plays a crucial role in the world's transportation
sector, and a lot of businesses rely on various airlines to connect them with other
parts of the world. But, extreme weather conditions may directly affect the airline
services by means of flight delays.


Problem Statement
========================================


The purpose of this project is to look at the approaches used to build classification model for
predicting flight delays in several classes on on basis of their historic route pattern.

Flight delays can be very annoying to airlines, airports, and passengers. Moreover, the development of accurate
prediction models for flight delays became very difficult due to the complexity of air transportation flight data. In this
project, we try to resolve this problem with approaches used to build flight delay prediction models using Calculating the
 centrality of their routs, and several new feature enginerrings.

Business Goals
========================================
Airlines are critical today for carrying people and commodities on time. Any delay in the schedule of these planes
can potentially disrupt the business and trade of thousands of employees at any given time. Therefore, precise
flight delay prediction is beneficial for the aviation industry and passenger travel. 

Expected Results
==================
DIn the United States, more than 8 million commercial flights take to the air each year. 25% of those flights experience delays, 
an ongoing problem that costs airlines more than $20 billion yearly. Although airlines, airports, and researchers often attempt to 
accurately predict and mitigate delays, they have been unable to customize and retrain their predictions as available data changes and grows.

Although predicting arrival delays of flights is a widely researched topic, there exist challenges in application of models in real world scenarios due to following shortcomings:

Rigorous analysis of Airline delay data we have developed a classification model which can classify Airline prediction in few class with reselct to 
theiir historic routs ppattern.

Solution
========================================



Steps
------
Feature Engineering & cleaning
---------------------------------------
In this transformation we have developed certain features like centrailities of their routs aggregation of their counts and 
as well we have taken care of data dreafting with time and removed outliers or skewed data.

Classification
--------------

Morever, Data feature engioneering and cleaning then we have trained data with SHapeley parameter. so, our 
moidel can use most effective features with resepect to their weights.
